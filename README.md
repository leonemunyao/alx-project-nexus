## ProDev Backend Engineering Program Overview

The ProDev Backend Program is a great learning experience for any aspiring professional Back-End Engineer. In this program, different technologies are learnt, while working on different projects to apply the skills learnt.

From `AI Prompting`, `Bash Piping`, `Database Design, Normalization, Optimization`, `SQL Joins`, `Python Decorators, Generators and Context Managers`, `Unit Testing`, `Django REST Framework` all the way to `Containerization(Docker and Kubernetes)` and `CI/CD Pipelines(Jenkins and Github Actions)`.

The concepts covered are as follows;

* **Key Technologies**
 
  * Python.
  * Django REST Framework
  * Docker and Kubernetes
  * Jenkins and Github Actions
  * SQL
  * GraphQL
  * REST APIs


Through the program, you go through important backend development concepts which some of them are as follows;

* Database Design - This is through the creation of ER Diagrams, Normalization and a Schema Design.

* SQL Joins - This is to combine data from multiple tables in a relational database for efficient data retrieval.

* Caching  - Improving performance with caching strategies. This to learn how to store copies of files to reduce the time needed to access them.

* Version Control - Branching strategies, gitflow main branches, git stashing and collaborative workflows.

* Advanced Shell Scripting - This to learn how to automate repetitive tasks by writing a sequence of commands in a script file.

* Containerization - This to understand how a developer can allow an application to be packaged and run in isolated environments, simplifying deployments and scaling.

* Web Infrastructure - This is about DNS, Server and DNS record types. 

* Container Orchestration with Kubernetes - This is the automated management, scaling and networking of containers.

* CI/CD Pipelines - This is setting up a continous intergration and continous deployment to enable rapid and reliable updates to applications using Jenkins and Github Actions.

* Automating tasks in Django - This is through scheduling tasks to make a certain events be executed automatically without a developers involvement.


* IP Tracking: Security and Analytics -  this is to enhance the security and maintaing legal compliance of a web application.

Over the program, several challenges are faced including imposter sydrome, depression, lack of understanding what the code is doing and what specific tasks require you to do.

All these can be overcome, first by having a peer who keeps you on check and motivates you to build together. Also having a dsciplined schedule that you can follow strictly that makes you show up everyday. This builds inner motivation and inner growth that makes you learn day by day.

The other concept is making sure you apply the daily three which are, `meditation`, `morning pages` and `walking(exercise)`.
