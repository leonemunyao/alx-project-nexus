## ProDev Backend Engineering Program Overview

The ProDev Backend Program is a great learning experience for any aspiring professional Back-End Engineer. In this program, different technologies are learnt, while working on different projects to apply the skills learnt.

From `AI Prompting`, `Bash Piping`, `Database Design, Normalization, Optimization`, `SQL Joins`, `Python Decorators, Generators and Context Managers`, `Unit Testing`, `Django REST Framework` all the way to `Containerization(Docker and Kubernetes)` and `CI/CD Pipelines(Jenkins and Github Actions)`.

The concepts covered are as follows;

* **Key Technologies**
 
  * Python.
  * Django REST Framework
  * Docker and Kubernetes
  * Jenkins and Github Actions
  * SQL
  * GraphQL
  * REST APIs


Through the program, you go through important backend development concepts which some of them are as follows;

* Database Design - This is through the creation of ER Diagrams, Normalization and a Schema Design.

* SQL Joins - This is to combine data from multiple tables in a relational database for efficient data retrieval.

* Caching  - Improving performance with caching strategies. This to learn how to store copies of files to reduce the time needed to access them.

* Version Control - Branching strategies, gitflow main branches, git stashing and collaborative workflows.

* Advanced Shell Scripting - This to learn how to automate repetitive tasks by writing a sequence of commands in a script file.

* Containerization - This to understand how a developer can allow an application to be packaged and run in isolated environments, simplifying deployments and scaling.

* Web Infrastructure - This is about DNS, Server and DNS record types. 

* Container Orchestration with Kubernetes - This is the automated management, scaling and networking of containers.

* CI/CD Pipelines - This is setting up a continous intergration and continous deployment to enable rapid and reliable updates to applications using Jenkins and Github Actions.

* Automating tasks in Django - This is through scheduling tasks to make a certain events be executed automatically without a developers involvement.


* IP Tracking: Security and Analytics -  this is to enhance the security and maintaing legal compliance of a web application.

Over the program, several challenges are faced including imposter sydrome, depression, lack of understanding what the code is doing and what specific tasks require you to do.

All these can be overcome, first by having a peer who keeps you on check and motivates you to build together. Also having a dsciplined schedule that you can follow strictly that makes you show up everyday. This builds inner motivation and inner growth that makes you learn day by day.

The other concept is making sure you apply the daily three which are, `meditation`, `morning pages` and `walking(exercise)`.

## LeoNexus Car Marketplace - Project Implementation

As part of the ProDev Backend Engineering Program, **LeoNexus** is a comprehensive full-stack car marketplace platform that demonstrates the practical application of modern web development technologies. This project showcases the integration of backend and frontend systems to create a complete automotive marketplace solution.

### 🚗 Project Overview

LeoNexus is a modern car marketplace platform that connects car dealers with potential buyers through an intuitive web interface. The platform enables dealers to manage their inventory and dealership profiles while providing buyers with advanced search capabilities and personalized experiences.

### 🏗 System Architecture

The project follows a **full-stack architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

**Backend (leonexus/)**: Django REST Framework API
- **Framework**: Django with Django REST Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Production) / SQLite (Development)  
- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication with role management
- **Image Handling**: Pillow for image processing and uploads

**Frontend (leonexusfrontend/)**: React TypeScript SPA
- **Framework**: React 18.3.1 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.4.19 for fast development and production builds
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility-first framework
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query + React Context

### � Deployment & Hosting

The LeoNexus platform is deployed using modern cloud infrastructure for optimal performance and scalability:

- **Backend API**: Hosted on **Render** for reliable Django REST Framework deployment
- **Frontend Application**: Deployed on **Vercel** for fast global content delivery
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database hosted on **Neon** for cloud-native data management

This cloud-first deployment strategy ensures high availability, automatic scaling, and seamless CI/CD integration.

### �🎯 Key Features

#### For Car Dealers
- **Inventory Management**: Complete CRUD operations for car listings
- **Dealership Profiles**: Create comprehensive business profiles with specialties
- **Image Gallery**: Multi-image upload support for vehicles

#### For Car Buyers  
- **Advanced Search**: Filter cars by make, model, year, price, and features
- **Detailed Views**: Comprehensive car information with image galleries
- **Reviews & Ratings**: Rate and review vehicle listings
- **Favorites System**: Save and manage preferred vehicles

#### Shared Functionality
- **Role-Based Access**: Separate interfaces for dealers and buyers
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data synchronization across the platform

### 🛠 Technical Implementation

#### Backend API Architecture
```

├── categories/         # Car categories management  
├── reviews/            # Review system
├── favorites/          # User favorites
├── dealerships/        # Dealer profile management
└── users/              # User registration & profiles
```

#### Frontend Component Structure

├── contexts/          # Global state management
├── services/          # API integration layer
└── hooks/             # Custom React hooks
```

### 📊 Database Design

The system uses a well-normalized relational database with key entities:
- **Users** with role-based access (Buyer/Dealer)
- **Dealerships** with business information and specialties
- **Cars** with detailed specifications and image galleries
- **Reviews** with ratings and user feedback
- **Categories** for vehicle classification
- **Favorites** for user preferences

### 🔒 Security & Authentication

- **JWT Token Authentication** for secure API access
- **Role-based permissions** ensuring dealers can only manage their own listings
- **Input validation** and sanitization on both frontend and backend
- **Protected routes** based on authentication status and user roles

### 🚀 Development Highlights

This project demonstrates proficiency in:
- **Full-stack development** with modern frameworks
- **RESTful API design** following industry best practices  
- **Database modeling** with proper normalization
- **Authentication systems** with role-based access control
- **Responsive UI development** with modern design principles
- **State management** in complex React applications
- **Type-safe development** using TypeScript
